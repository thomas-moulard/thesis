Its presentation makes the mathematical underpinnings of robot motion accessible to students of computer science and engineering, rleating low-level implementation details to high-level algorithmic concepts.}},

@book{08siciliano,
  abstract = {Robotics is undergoing a major transformation in scope and dimension.
	Starting from a predominantly industrial focus, robotics has been
	rapidly expanding into the challenges of unstructured environments.
	The Springer Handbook of Robotics incorporates these new developments
	and therefore basically differs from other handbooks of robotics
	focusing on industrial applications. It presents a widespread and
	well-structured coverage from the foundations of robotics, through
	the consolidated methodologies and technologies, up to the new emerging
	application areas of robotics. The handbook is an ideal resource
	for robotics experts but also for people new to this expanding field
	such as engineers, medical doctors, computer scientists, designers.


	Reaching for the human frontier, robotics is vigorously engaged in
	the growing challenges of new emerging domains. Interacting, exploring,
	and working with humans, the new generation of robots will increasingly
	touch people and their lives. The credible prospect of practical
	robots among humans is the result of the scientific endeavour of
	a half a century of robotic developments that established robotics
	as a modern scientific discipline. The Springer Handbook of Robotics
	brings a widespreadand well-structured compilation of classic and
	emerging application areas of robotics. From the foundations to the
	social and ethical implications of robotics, the handbook provides
	a comprehensive collection of the accomplishments in the field, and
	constitutes a premise of further advances towards new challenges
	in robotics.


	This handbook, edited by two internationally renowned scientists with
	the support of an outstanding team of seven part editors and onehundred
	sixty-four authors, is an authoritative reference for robotics researchers,
	newcomers to the field, and scholars from related disciplines such
	as biomechanics, neurosciences, virtual simulation, animation, surgery,
	and sensor networks among others.},

abstract={ A development of humanoid robot HRP-2 is presented in this paper. HRP-2 is a humanoid robotics platform, which we developed in phase two of HRP. HRP was a humanoid robotics project, which had run by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan from 1998FY to 2002FY for five years. The ability of the biped locomotion of HRP-2 is improved so that HRP-2 can cope with uneven surface, can walk at two third level of human speed, and can walk on a narrow path. The ability of whole body motion of HRP-2 is also improved so that HRP-2 can get up by a humanoid robot's own self if HRP-2 tips over safely. In this paper, the appearance design, the mechanisms, the electrical systems, specifications, and features upgraded from its prototype are also introduced.},

We first recall the principle of the trajectory deformation and the role of the potential field gradient in the configuration space. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First we show that the potential field gradient can be computed without any closed-form expression of the potential function if this latter depends only on the distance between the robot and the obstacles. Then an algorithm to filter obstacles that have no influence in Robot-Obstacle interactions is presented. This algorithm takes advantage of the spatial coherence of the planned trajectory, and has been evaluated by experiments on mobile robot Hilare2 towing a trailer.},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of understanding the shape of the locomotor trajectories for a human being walking in an empty space to reach a goal defined both in position and in direction. Among all the possible trajectories reaching a given goal what are the fundamental reasons to chose one trajectory instead of another? The underlying idea to attack this question has been to relate this problem to an optimal control problem: the trajectory is chosen according to some optimization principle. This is our basic starting assumption. The subject being viewed as a controlled system, the question becomes what criteria is optimized? Is it the time to perform the trajectory? the length of the path? the minimum jerk along the path?... In this study we show that the human locomotor trajectories are well approximated by the geodesics of a differential system minimizing the L2 norm of the control. Such geodesics are made of arcs of clothoids. The clothoid or Cornu spiral is a curve, whose curvature grows with the distance from the origin. The study is based on an experimental protocol involving 7 subjects. They had to walk within a motion capture room from a fixed starting point, and to cross over distant porches from which both position in the room and orientation were changing over trials.},
